This is a [coding challenge](https://github.com/Feeld/frontend-developer-test) for the company
[Feeld](https://feeld.co/). The challenge took take place between 2019-07-27 and 2019-08-03. The
task was to create a dating app in [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/),
[Expo](https://expo.io/) and, [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

To quickly run this app on Android, install the
[Expo app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&referrer=www) then scan
the QR code [here](https://expo.io/@jonrh/akur) or below with your with your camera:

## How to run and develop on your own computer

1. Make sure you have recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. The latest
   LTS (long term support) version is a safe bet.

2. Install the [Expo client](https://expo.io/learn) command: `npm install expo-cli --global`
3. Install the [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en) or [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id982107779) Expo app on your phone.
4. Clone this repository to your own computer: `git clone https://github.com/jonrh/frontend-developer-test`
5. Move into the newly cloned folder and run `yarn install` or `npm install`
6. Run `yarn start` or `npm start`
7. The app will be complied and a browser window will open up. Open the camera on your mobile phone
   (or a QR scanning app) and scan the QR code in the lower left corner of the web page that opened
   up. The app should then load onto your phone. This assumes your computer and your mobile phone
   are on the same LAN network. If they are not try selecting "Tunnel" in the lower left and scan
   the QR code again.

## Work in progress note:

- User with ID "55be3c90c964860700ebf5dd" has an interest with an emoji. I should make sure that
  emojis can render properly in text elements. I forgot if they did or not. I just remember that in
  Creact React App emojis need to be put into <span> elements with the correct attributes. Just
  wondering if the same applies here for React Native.
- I discovered that the response from the API can contain the same user multiple times in the same
  request. I created a script outside the project that called the API about 30 times and extracted
  all 100 unique user objects and put them in the `users.ts` file.
- There is a bug in react-native-swiper. Sometimes the photo state doesn't get updated correctly
  when flipping through photos. I don't really have time to address it right now. A user can flip
  through the photos, it's just that the UX isn't optimal because the photos don't loop around.

## Files & Folders

- `.expo/`: TODO
- `assets/`: Images (app icon, splash screen), fonts, videos that the app uses.
- `node_modules/`: Third party JavaScript dependencies. This folder is created and populated after
  running the command `yarn install` or `npm install`. This folder should not be modified.
- `source/`: Contains the source code of the app.
  - `Main.tsx`: The root component of the app.
  - `users.ts`: A TypeScript file that contains all 100 users provided by the Feeld API. Note: not
    submitted to git, kept private for now.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies what files and folders we don't want to keep track of in our
  [Git](https://git-scm.com/) repository.
- `.watchmanconfig`: TODO
- `app.json`: App configurations that do not belong to code. Name of app, SDK versions to use, etc.
- `App.tsx`: The main entry point into the app as dictated by the Expo framework. Just a shell that
  redirects to `source/Main.tsx`.
- `babel.config.js`: TODO
- `package.json`: List of third party dependencies (such as JavaScript or Typescript), project
  settings and scripts to run the project. More info [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json).
- `prettier.config.js`: Settings file for our automatic source code formatter
  [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier comes with some
- `readme.md`: This document. Introductory text to help readers understand what this is and how to
  get started developing.
- `tsconfig.json`: TODO
- `yarn.lock`: An autogenerated file by the [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/yarn-lock/)
  package manager. It allows us to get consistent installs across machines. Avoids rare but very
  painful inconsistency bugs.

# Original Challenge Description by Feeld

Hi! welcome to Feeld. As part of the recruitment process we want to know how you think, code and
structure your work. In order to do that, we're going to ask you to complete this coding challenge.

## Some background

Feeld is a dating app. People are free to browse profiles and decide whether they like them or not.

## What we expect

- Build a performant, clean and well structured solution;
- Commit early and often. We want to be able to check your progress;
- Feel free to address the problem creatively according to your programming tastes (there are
  always multiple ways to achieve the same goal) and try to use elegant solutions.
- Feeld.co is a design-driven app. Your solution should look _modern, relevant, simple and in line
  with our brand image_
- Go the extra mile. The requirements below are just the bare minimum. Be creative and come up with
  a solution that will impress us. If you think our requirements are whack, or not appropriate,
  change them and explain why
- You have **one week** to complete this challenge

## The Challenge

Our backend team has created an API that will give you a bunch of user profiles, and you have been
given some (very lose) requirements from the product team

- You must build an app that displays these users in an atractive way (think Tinder, Grindr,
  Happn, Hinge)
- The API will return the following information about a user:

```
{
    "id": "55be3c8fc964860700ebf515",
    "info": {
        "age": 20,
        "type": "single",
        "gender": "male",
        "sexuality": "straight",
        "name": "D",
        // a short text about them
        "about": "\"Tell us more about you\"",
        // a list of desires
        "desires": [
            "Food"
        ],
        // a list of tags they're interested in
        "interests": [
            "Food"
        ]
    },
    "associated": null, // if they're a couple, this will be populated
    "photos": [ // this will be a list of zero or more photos
        {
            "url": "...",
            "width": 716,
            "height": 716
        }
    ]
}
```

- A user should be able to make a decision (Like or Dislike) on the user, but they don't _have_ to,
  i.e. they can skip the profile.
- The user should be able to browse another user's photos

## Accessing the API

API Root URL: https://fld-devtest-api.herokuapp.com

The API is authenticated using the following session token that must be supplied in the HTTP
request headers (using the `session-token` key):

```
3TtY+AVtEJMaOPWGyEulVEgVBWZ8gqM75gag6wCcA3rJCYWMkX/ZmAOJxrZ4bPyBLJBch7VyMYD8ZCWoNPCUnJbT5M2iRWjJteGrfNhFzd+0oDbWQwiNAIdG0W9rHw7sKAAWk5uEzjs+lPykJnmy56LRwSFpoyxHC7p9G3KTQoQ=
```

### Endpoints

There's only one—`/api/v1/users`—which will return 20 unique users picked at random from a set of
100 users. You can call this endpoint using Curl as follows:

```
curl -H 'session-token: 3TtY+AVtEJMaOPWGyEulVEgVBWZ8gqM75gag6wCcA3rJCYWMkX/ZmAOJxrZ4bPyBLJBch7VyMYD8ZCWoNPCUnJbT5M2iRWjJteGrfNhFzd+0oDbWQwiNAIdG0W9rHw7sKAAWk5uEzjs+lPykJnmy56LRwSFpoyxHC7p9G3KTQoQ=' \
https://fld-devtest-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/users
```

## Your task:

1. Fork this repo
2. Produce an expo React Native app that calls the provided API and displays users. Make it public
   and send us a link so we can open it
3. Create a readme file explaining your technical choices, architecture and if you have them, your
   ideas and suggestions.
4. Send us a PR.

GOOD LUCK!
