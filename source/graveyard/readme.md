# Dev Graveyard

This folder contains files and components I used while developing and testing new things. For
example the file `ListOfUsers.tsx` was a component to help me visualise users in a list. The
`SwipeTester` files were a sandbox where I prototyped using gesture handling and animations.
Normally I would not keep files like this around in a git repository but since this is a coding
challenge with the objective to understand how I go about solving problems I thought it could be
insightful to keep it around.
